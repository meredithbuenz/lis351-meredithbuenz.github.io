		<p2>		The purpose of this website is to tell employers, friends, and family a bit more about myself. Please browse the  site and feel free to contact me using the tab in the navigation bar. The entire site has been hand coded by me for a project in Intro to Digital Information at UW-Madison. Enjoy! <br>

		Hi! My name is Meredith Buenz and I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison receiving by Bachelors of Business Administration in Marketing and a certificate in Digital Studies. For my certificate, I am taking a class where I learn about digital information and computers, so I have coded this entire website using html and css myself. <br>
		<br>
		This website highlights my personal and professional life and is a small glimpse into me. I am currently a Paid Search intern at Ovative Group and I plan to start as a full time analyst following my graduation in May. I will be moving to their New York office and I cannot wait for this next chapter of life. <br>
		<br>
		In my free time I like to spend time with my amazing family and friends, find and cook new recipes, spend time outside, exercise, and listen to music and podcasts. I am passionate about making connections with the people around me and feel so lucky to be surrounded by amazing people and environments that allow me to live my life to the fullest.
