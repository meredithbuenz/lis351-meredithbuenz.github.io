					<dd><article>In 2022, I had the chance to travel to so many amazing places. I studied abroad in Dublin, Ireland for five months and travelled Europe on the weekends. I got to visit my sister in Paris, visit friends in London, Florence, and Prague, and see so many other amazing places. My favorite city was Amsterdam. I visited during the tulip festival and had the most amazing time exploring the city in the sunny weather.</article></dd>
